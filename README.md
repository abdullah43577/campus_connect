## Technology Implementation

The Campus Connect platform consists of a responsive front-end interface paired with a robust server-side architecture. The email notification system plays a crucial role in keeping users informed about account activities, event updates, and platform announcements. The MJML template provides a consistent, mobile-responsive email experience across all communication touchpoints.
